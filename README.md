# pattern_1
Implement the creation of different worlds for a computer game with
using a suitable design pattern. The game has different continents (planets, worlds). The world on each continent is characterized by the presence of food chains (plants - herbivores - predators), although the specific representatives of flora and fauna in different worlds differ. Despite the differences between representatives of the worlds, the nature of the interaction between animals remains unchanged.
